# Complete AI/ML Portfolio Website Technical Implementation Plan

## Frontend Architecture & Core Technologies

### Primary Framework: Next.js 14 with App Router
**Why this choice**: Next.js 14 provides the perfect balance of static site generation for performance and server-side rendering for dynamic content like your blog. The App Router enables advanced routing patterns and seamless page transitions that create a professional user experience.

**Key Configuration**:
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for main portfolio sections
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** for blog content and dynamic project data
- **Edge Runtime** for contact forms and API routes
- **Image Optimization** with Next.js Image component for performance

### Language & Type Safety: TypeScript
**Implementation Strategy**: Use TypeScript throughout the entire project to demonstrate professional development practices. Create custom type definitions for your project data, blog posts, and API responses. This shows potential employers your understanding of type safety and scalable code architecture.

**Key Type Definitions**:
- Project schema with metadata, technologies, and deployment information
- Blog post structure with frontmatter and content types
- Contact form validation schemas
- Animation state management types

### Styling & Design System: Tailwind CSS + Custom CSS
**Approach**: Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling that enables rapid development while maintaining consistent design patterns. Combine this with custom CSS for advanced animations and unique visual effects that showcase your attention to detail.

**Design System Components**:
- **Color Palette**: Define semantic color variables that work across light and dark themes
- **Typography Scale**: Implement fluid typography that adapts to screen sizes
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing units that create visual harmony
- **Component Library**: Reusable components for cards, buttons, and interactive elements

### Animation & Interaction Libraries

#### Framer Motion for Component Animations
**Purpose**: Handle page transitions, component mounting/unmounting, and complex gesture-based interactions. Framer Motion provides the declarative animation API that makes sophisticated animations maintainable and performant.

**Implementation Examples**:
- Page transition animations that create smooth navigation between sections
- Staggered animations for project cards that create engaging reveal effects
- Drag and drop interactions for project filtering and organization
- Micro-interactions for buttons and interactive elements

#### React Spring for Physics-Based Animations
**Use Case**: Handle animations that require realistic physics like bouncing effects, natural easing, and complex interpolations. This library complements Framer Motion by handling animations that need to feel physically realistic.

**Specific Applications**:

### State Management: Zustand + React Query
**Architecture Decision**: Zustand provides lightweight state management for UI interactions and theme preferences, while React Query handles server state and caching for blog content and project data.

**State Management Strategy**:
- **Global UI State**: Theme preferences, navigation state, animation preferences
- **Local Component State**: Form inputs, modal visibility, animation triggers
- **Server State**: Blog posts, project metadata, contact form submissions
- **Cached Data**: Optimized loading of images and dynamic content

## Backend Architecture & Services

### API Layer: Next.js API Routes with Edge Runtime
**Implementation**: Use Next.js API routes for serverless functions that handle contact forms, blog management, and dynamic content generation. Edge runtime provides global distribution and fast response times.
